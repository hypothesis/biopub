<h1>BioPub</h1>

<p><strong>BioPub</strong> is a website created for demonstration purposes showing how a
publisher can embed Hypothesis on parts of their website and customize various
aspects of its behavior. This includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Customizing the default annotation layer.</strong> By default the Hypothesis client
shows annotations from the
"<a href="https://hypothes.is/groups/__world__/public">Public</a>" layer (or "group")
which is moderated by Hypothesis staff. Publishers can change this to a layer
that belongs to them and which they can moderate according to their own
policies. These layers can be open to contributions from all Hypothesis users,
or restricted to a specifically invited set of users.</li>
<li><strong>Changing the look and feel of the client.</strong> Publishers can customize various
aspects of the look and feel of the annotation tool in order to better fit
the existing look of their website and reflect their brand.</li>
<li><strong>Interacting with the annotation client.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Customizing Hypothesis on your own site</h2>

<p>For more details on how to customize Hypothesis on your own site, see the
<a href="http://h-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/publishers/">documentation for the Hypothesis
client</a>.</p>

<h2>Custom annotation groups</h2>

<p>If you are interested in creating custom annotation groups to replace the
default "Public" group on your site, please <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/contact/">contact
us</a>. Please note that although you can
customize the default group that visitors to your site will see, logged-in
Hypothesis users will still be able to create their own private groups and share
them with others.</p>
